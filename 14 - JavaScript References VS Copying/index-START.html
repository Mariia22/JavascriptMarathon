    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    players2.push('Mariia');

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players5 = players.slice();
    console.log(players5);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players4 = [...players];
    console.log(players4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const players6 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(players6);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const mariia = person;
    mariia.age = 30;
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const lena = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(lena);

    const aleks = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log(aleks);
